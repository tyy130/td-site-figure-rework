## 🐧 Tux — Linux Custodian AI Agent

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Tux.svg/265px-Tux.svg.png" align="right" width="200" alt="Tux the Linux Penguin">

Meet **[Tux](https://github.com/Tactic-Dev/tux-chat)**, a secure, LLM-powered **Linux system administrator** that understands natural language and executes system tasks safely.

Instead of memorizing terminal commands, you tell Tux **what you need** — and it plans, validates, and executes securely.

### 🛡️ Security-First Architecture
- 🔒 **Defense in Depth** — 4-layer security model: Flatpak UI + User Agent + Sandboxed Adapters + Polkit System Service  
- 🚫 **Zero Direct Access** — LLM and UI have NO direct host access; all privilege escalation via Polkit  
- 📦 **Bubblewrap Sandboxing** — Read-only/limited-write adapters run in isolated namespaces  
- 🔐 **Polkit Authorization** — Every privileged action requires user authentication  

### 🎯 Capabilities
- 📦 **Package Management** — Install, update, remove packages with natural language  
- 💾 **Storage Operations** — List devices, mount/unmount, disk usage analysis  
- ⚙️ **System Control** — Start/stop services, check status, manage systemd units  
- 🧠 **Multi-Step Planning** — LLM generates execution plans with reasoning before acting  

Tux embodies our philosophy: **powerful automation without compromising security**.
